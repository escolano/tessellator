## Features

Tessellator is a mesher focused on generate meshes and data structures which are suitable for FDTD algorithms. It includes the following capabilities:

- Generate staircased meshes from lines, surfaces, and volumes.
- Support for rectilinear (graded) grids.
- Import/Export in STL or VTK formats.
- Conflict resolution between different layers using a predefined hierarchy.
- Generate conformal meshes with fixed distance intersection with grid planes.

## Compilation

How to build and test: 
can have a look to comnmands "tessellator\.github\workflows\build-and-test.yml "

0. install git : https://git-scm.com/downloads
1- install cmake: https://cmake.org/ 

2- install vcpkg
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg && bootstrap-vcpkg.bat

Configure the VCPKG_ROOT environment variable (better do it permantent)
set "VCPKG_ROOT=C:\path\to\vcpkg"
set PATH=%VCPKG_ROOT%;%PATH%

3- clone tessellator

git clone https://github.com/OpenSEMBA/tessellator.git

4- 
* Windows Visual Studio: config: Release or Debug
Warning: avoid clone it in a folder with spaces in the name of cmake will fail !!
cd tessellator
cmake --preset msbuild -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release -j

* Linux
cd tessellator
cmake --preset gnu -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release -j

When using presets, make sure to define the environment variable `VCPKG_ROOT` to your `vcpkg` installation.
This can be done using a `CMakeUserPreset.json` file, for example:

```json
{
  "version": 4,

  "include": ["CMakePresets.json"],
  "configurePresets": [
    {
      "name": "gnu-local",
      "displayName": "GNU local",
      "environment": {
        "VCPKG_ROOT": "~/workspace/vcpkg/"
      },
      "cacheVariables": {
        "TESSELLATOR_ENABLE_CGAL": true
      },
      "inherits": "gnu"
    }
  ]
}
```
